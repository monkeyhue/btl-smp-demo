# btl-smp-demo
Demo of Battledoors for code review prior to the Smithed SMP. Only contains features that are polished and considered finished or nearly finished.

### Notes:
- The Smithed Actionbar, Smithed Crafter and Smithed Block libraries will be required to run this pack, but Smithed Actionbar is included natively with this git.
- The resourcepack can only be used in vanilla, or with Sodium.
- Currently, the objmc version used with Battledoors is not compatible with Common Shaders. Until this is resolved, I can't push to smithed.
- Potential issues with crashing on Fabric clients? Needs more investigation.
